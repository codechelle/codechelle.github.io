## Welcome

If you're reading this, then you've made it to my Github! Hooray, welcome! Reading this file here hopefully means that you're even more interested in my skills and problem-solving abilities. Stay tuned for more updates to my site here as I continue to rebuild.

Enjoy!

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
